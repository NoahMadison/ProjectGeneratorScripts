# ProjectGeneratorScripts
These shell scripts generate project files and premake luas for C, C++, and C#.
The build.sh expects there to be a sub directory titled "PreMake" with a Premake executable titled "premake5linux".

The build.sh is not necessary. Just running the premake executable in the same directory ProjectCreator.sh was run will work.
